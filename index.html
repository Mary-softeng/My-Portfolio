        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have two years of experience as a data analyst, and I am well-versed in 
            the entire data analysis process, from data collection and cleaning to feature 
            engineering, model training, and hosting. I'm highly proficient in SQL, Python, and R programming, 
            allowing me to work efficiently with large datasets, automate tasks, and generate actionable insights. 
            My experience with DevOps engineering enables me to streamline the deployment and monitoring of data 
            models for smooth operations. Additionally, I bring strong problem-solving skills, 
            which help me tackle complex analytical challenges and deliver effective, optimized solutions.</p>

            <p>In this project, the main aim was to cluster different factors that could lead to a company/ individual being declared
                bankrupt or not, by determining their financial positions such as(stable,potential and/or at risk).The clustering methods that
                were used are KMeans clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. The machine learning algorithm that was used was Random
                Forest and the language used was python.</p>
